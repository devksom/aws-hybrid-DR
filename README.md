AWS Hybrid disaster recovery
This project seeks to provide various scenarios of disaster recovery for a Traditional on prem data center.
Each scenario expatiated here has varying levels of RTO and RPO. 
THe higher the RTO and RPO , the higher the complexity and cost

## Scenario 1
Storage gateway service will be used to migrate a block based volume storage from on premise to an AWS Region. THis will however be simulated using two different regions.
US-EAST-1 represents the On Premise data center
